Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits.
For example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers.

Pseudo Code:
1. First write a function to get user input for the number to check if it is a Armstrong one or not!
2. Now we have to multiply each number from that number to the power of the number numbers available 
in that number!

like 1234 will have 1**4 2**4 3**4 4**4
and 12 will have 1**2 and 2**2
or 123 will have 1**3 2**3 3**3

3. You have to convert the int input into a number using str(num) in python
and num.toString() javascript so that you can access individuaL parts of the number

4. use int(num) for python and Number(num) convert the number again into integers.
